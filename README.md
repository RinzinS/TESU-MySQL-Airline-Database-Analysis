# TESU-MySQL-Airline-Database-Analysis-Airline Performance Analytics (SQL Project)

This project analyzes airline carrier performance across six major U.S. airports: ATL, DCA, IAD, BWI, JAX, and TPA. Using SQL queries on a structured flight database, the analysis evaluates flight volume, delay metrics, market share, and aircraft age to identify the most efficient and reliable carriers.

Objective
To determine optimal airline carriers based on:
- Total nonstop flights between airport pairs
- Market share by airport and carrier
- Average arrival and departure delays
- Seasonal performance trends
- Aircraft age and its impact on reliability

 Key Insights
- **Delta Airlines** leads in performance and coverage, especially from ATL, with high volume and low delays.
- **Southwest Airlines** performs well in Florida-based routes and peak travel seasons.
- **Spirit Airlines** shows higher delay rates and lower reliability.
- Aircraft age does not directly correlate with poor performance â€” maintenance and strategy matter more.

 SQL Techniques Used
- Aggregation with `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY`
- Multi-level subqueries and joins
- Conditional logic for quarterly analysis
- Market share calculations using nested queries
- Delay analysis by route and carrier

Files Included
- `MySQL Final Project.pdf`: Full report with visuals, query breakdowns, and executive summary
- `README.md`: Project overview and context

Academic Context
Completed as part of the Master's in Data Science & Analytics program at Thomas Edison State University (DSI-5300-MD900). Demonstrates proficiency in SQL, schema-driven analysis, and data storytelling.

Recommendation
Delta Airlines is the top choice for travelers prioritizing punctuality and coverage from ATL. Southwest is a strong alternative for regional travel in Florida.

Personal Reflection
This project strengthened my ability to extract insights from structured databases and communicate findings through visual storytelling. It also reinforced my SQL proficiency and prepared me for Python-based automation and future analytics work.
